# Python_L1_Project

# Preamble

The legend goes that the mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras was convinced throughout his life that Nature was entirely governed by numerical ratios, including sounds. He recognized that musical harmony exploits simple relationships between whole numbers. Much later, Leibniz posited that: "Music is a hidden arithmetic exercise of the soul, which does not know that it is counting."

Over time, a multitude of links between mathematics and music have been discovered or introduced, then studied and utilized by instrument makers and composers. Hence the bold claim that nothing distinguishes music from mathematics.

To appreciate the link between these two disciplines, we propose in this project to create music by manipulating mathematics.

## Task Description

This project is to be carried out in the Python programming language. Its main objective is the creation of new musical scores. For this purpose, a database of musical scores is provided in the file "partitions.txt". These correspond to the melodies of children's nursery rhymes. This file must be read, analyzed, and then used to compose new musical rhythms to be offered to toddlers :-)

### Features

The project involves:
(a) Encoding of musical notes;
(b) Assigning frequencies and durations to the notes;
(c) Applying mathematical transformations such as transposition or inversion to create new musical scores;
(d) Using Markov chains (2 versions) to create new scores from one or more melodies;

### Application

The final application must provide the user with a menu to choose from:
(a) Playing a score from those displayed on the screen.
(b) Playing a new score provided in the form of a file.
(c) Transforming a given score by applying either transposition or inversion.
(d) Composing a new score based on the style of the scores present in the database.
(e) The possibility of enriching the database by adding new scores.

### Graphic Illustration

Furthermore, all musical readings must be accompanied by a graphical illustration which can be:
(a) A drawing of a musical instrument with animation (e.g., Piano);
(b) A spectrogram;
(c) Musical notes;
(d) Other suggestions...

**Note**: It should be noted that any new score generated or read by the user must be systematically added to the database.
